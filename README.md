# TicTacToe
Every new coder is supposed to take a stab at Tic Tac Toe, right? Well, this is that. 2-player tic tac toe in the terminal. 

Here are the rules I followed, found on [this Medium article](https://medium.com/hackernoon/how-to-fail-a-coding-interview-8d02cb70225f):
- Terminal-based interface.
- Turn-based gameplay; the one player makes a move after another one.
- At the very beginning and after each turn, the game shows whose turn it is, and allows to make a choice.
- When the turn is submitted, the game automatically shows a new board’s state and analyzes if there is a winner. If there is one, the UI shows information about the winner, and the game ends.
- The game is written in Python ≥ 3.x.
Sounds very straightforward, right? The greatest twist here is a time limit. You’re only given a 1 hour to build the MVP, i.e., working terminal-based game for two players. Also, there is an additional list of priorities that clarify and extend the design requirements. Note that they list in the order of decreasing importance.
  1. The game meets the minimum requirements stated above.
  2. The UI is intuitive and doesn’t require additional instructions.
  3. The code is well-structured, compact, and easy to read.
  4. Tests are proving the correctness of the developed program and its components.
  5. The game can handle incorrect input.
  6. The UI is convenient.
  7. The code uses modern language features and libraries.
